# LEAST

LEAST is intended to be a Low Effort Application Start Template.  The primary goal is to provide just enough boilerplate architecture and components for a developer to immediately begin building out the desired application behavior with minimal time spent creating the scaffolding behind.

To achieve this goal, the template establishes the project structure and coding practices through the use of pre-defined components and opinionated static code analyzers.
