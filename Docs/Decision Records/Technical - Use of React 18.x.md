# Use of React 18.x
__[Technical]__

## Status

Assumed

## Context

This project will be used to update the foundation of existing projects written in React 18.x or lower.

React 19 is available, but support documentation is still identified as "beta".  React 19 introduces significant architectural changes that impact how code is structured.

## Decision

This project will target React 18.x

## Consequences

Existing project UI components will be more easily absorbed and translated into this project, allowing those projects to eventually be fully migrated to use the LEAST foundation.

Potential improvements of React 19 codebase will be deferred; they may be incorporated in the future after the LEAST foundation has stabalized.
